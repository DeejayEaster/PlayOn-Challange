# PlayOn! Sports coding challenge

<https://elated-yalow-f98c0d.netlify.app/>

Greetings, this is my submission to the PlayOn! code assesment. Below I have included some simple instruction on how to run the code. I also provided a link to the deployed code. Thank you dor your time.

## How to run the code

### Install Node.JS

Be sure that Node.JS installed in your enviornment. You can follow this link to install Node.JS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once installed you may clone this repository.

### Install all dependencies and packages within

open a terminal or powershell and cd into the directory in which you cloned the repo. Then run the following:

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Once everything is install, please run the following command

```
npm run serve
```

### Using the Application

The header and footer are for cosmetic purposes only. On the top of the application you will see two methods of filtering: By events within a date range as well as by state association.

### One Last Note

If you look at the commit history you will see commits from gabeaster. I am using a shared computer and did not check to see which user was logged into the git CLI. My bad!
